    <p>Welcome to our website! We are glad to have you here. Explore our services and learn more about us.</p>

<p>We are Alight
Alight, established in 1978 as the American Refugee Committee, 
works alongside displaced people to co-create high-quality services
 and programs that address their needs. We refer to the displaced as our "customers" 
 instead of â€œbeneficiaries" as a reminder that their voices guide our decisions. 
 We also work closely with affiliate organizations to expand our impact around the world.
